    <p>Maggi noodles are curry flavoured instant noodles popular in India, Singapore, Malaysia and many more countries, I'll be showing you what I personally think is the best way to cook maggi noodles.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Half a glass of water</li>
      <li>One packet of Maggi noodles</li>
      <li>An egg</li>
      <li>(Optional)Three small birds eye chili peppers</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>Start on medium heat. Add the half glass of water to your pot. Chop up your chili peppers and add them in if you want them, and add your noodles and noodles seasoning. Then turn up to high heat. If the noodles are still not done and it seems like all the soup is going to evaporate, turn it down a little and just add a little water, not too much. You want the minimum amount of soup to concentrate that seasoning. Once the noodles cook and theres only a bit of soup, turn off the heat and serve. </p>
    
<p>There you have it! The ultimate Maggi. The concentrated soup will add immense flavour to your noodles, enjoy!</p>
