    <p>Ahh, half-boiled eggs. a staple of the singaporean breakfast and a loved dish by many. And you can make it at home! I'll teach you.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>White pepper</li>
      <li>Salty soy sauce</li>
      <li>One or two eggs (depending on how hungry you are)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Start by boiling some water, whether it be by kettle or boiling a pot of water on the stove. Once the water has finished boiling, kill the heat if you're using a stove and drop your egg(s) in the kettle or pot and let it cook for 6 minutes.</p>
    
    <p>Once the 6 minutes are up, fish your eggs out and crack them into a bowl or plate, season with salty soy sauce and white pepper to taste and voila! A tasty breakfast, enjoy!</p>
