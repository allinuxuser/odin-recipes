    <p>Kaya Toast, the perfect pairing to half-boiled eggs (see last recipe). Whether you're dipping it in the half-boiled eggs or eating it on its own, it's bound to be delicious! It uses some unorthodox ingredients, but if you go out of the way to get them, you'll be surprised by it's deliciousness.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Kaya (Coconut Jam)</li>
      <li>Planta (Margarine)</li>
      <li>Bread</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>First, toast two slices of bread. After the slices are toasted, spread kaya and planta on each slice respectively. Now, put them on top of eachother, slice them into triangles if you want, and voila! Kaya toast. Bon appetit!</p>
